# FunctionalAnnotation_Uncertainty_16S
This repository provides a customizable pipeline to access and summarize all whole genome annotations for prokaryotic genome assemblies hosted on GenBank and RefSeq. It also contains some functions for visualizing important characteristics of your dataset prior to annotation. It has been formatted as an R package, for easy installation. This pipeline does not include components to re-annotate the genomes, rather to summarize existing annotations. This approach requires far less memory and computational power. To install:

# Pipeline process:

The core pipeline and implementation is described in []

# Other informative visualizations

A short vignette describing the rational behind this package is in [].

Coming soon: Tools for predicting functional gene abundance perform poorly in general. Chapter 2 of my dissertation covers why this is, and what we can do about it. The core analysis with figures will be presented here.
