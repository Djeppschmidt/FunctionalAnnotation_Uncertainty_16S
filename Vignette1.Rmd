## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# import reference dataset
# refdir from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/
# filter set to only bacteria and archaea
# and only whole genomes
refdir<-as.data.frame(as.matrix(read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/SoilHealthDB/prokaryotes.csv", sep=",")))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
